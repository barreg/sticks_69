# sticks_69
<<<<<<< HEAD

A Flutter project, aimed at designing an app to locate stickers we stick with our friends. The goal is simple: when we stick a sticker somewhere in the street, we can add it on the map, and all the users can see it. The app also has a Pictures tab, where we can add pictures. 
It uses the google maps package, and quite a few others.
